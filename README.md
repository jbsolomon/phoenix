# Phoenix

A simple, experimental, cross-platform, procedural game engine in C++.

Phoenix is currently under heavy development and is not ready for more
than developer usage.  A timeline will be posted when one is available.

Phoenix supports iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux, with planned support
for Android devices which support Vulkan.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have a C++ compiler or dev stack prepared which
supports the latest C++ standards, such as Visual Studio 2019, Xcode, or
GCC.

The recommended Phoenix workflow revolves around the `phx` CLI.

### The `phx` CLI

The `phx` CLI is a tool which supports various Phoenix developer and
user workflows, such as setting up new projects and preparing game
assets.

You can get it by following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/phoenix-engine/phx) or by downloading Go and
running:

```sh
$ go get -u -v github.com/phoenix-engine/phx
```
